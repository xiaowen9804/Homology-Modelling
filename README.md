# Homology-Modelling
Provide two input files and a R script for the integrator unit.

File `MBP1_MYSPE-APSESrenum.pdb` is the pdb file of Model based on 1BM8, which has been re-numbered. It can be directly loaded and used.

File `MBP1_MYSPE-APSES_new.pdb` is the pdb file of the 4UX5 model which has been downloaded from SwissModel server after step 1.4 in the R script. It serves as the input file, and downstream files can be generated through HomologyModels.R.

`1BM8_A.fa` and `4UX5_A.fa` are template sequences in FASTA files.
